# Multiple Linear Regression - Marketing Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales based on various marketing strategies such as TV, Social Media, Radio, and Influencer promotions. Using Multiple Linear Regression, we explore the relationships between marketing campaigns and sales and create a model to estimate future sales.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for sales based on marketing data.
- Analyze the relationship between marketing channels (TV, Social Media, Radio, Influencer) and sales.
- Check the assumptions of the regression model and interpret the results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Statsmodels** for fitting the linear regression model.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for project execution.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `marketing_sales_data.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `TV`: Spending on TV advertisements.
- `Social_Media`: Spending on social media campaigns.
- `Radio`: Spending on radio advertisements.
- `Influencer`: Spending on influencer marketing.
- `Sales`: The resulting sales from the above marketing efforts.

## Steps/Approach:
1. **Problem Definition**: Understand the problem of predicting sales based on marketing efforts.
2. **Data Collection**: Load and explore the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze relationships between marketing strategies and sales.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode variables if necessary.
5. **Model Building**: Implement the Multiple Linear Regression model using `Statsmodels`.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model assumptions and interpret the results.
7. **Results and Interpretation**: Understand the significance of each feature in predicting sales.
